# Simon Boardman
Clinical Bioinformatician

<i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> <a href="mailto:simon.boardman@gmail.com">simon.boardman@gmail.com</a>

## Currently

I am a Clinical Scientist specialising in Bioinformatics (Genomics). In my day-to-day role I run and develop diagnostic pipelines for processing patient samples within the Leeds Genetics Laboratory. 

I work in collaboration with other clinical bioinformaticians to create and maintain scientific software for clinical use. The main languages I use are Python and Perl. A key part of my job is communicating results to genetics clinical scientists and working in multi-disciplinary teams to design and implement new tests to improve the services available to patients.
