# Simon Boardman
Clinical Bioinformatician

<i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> <a href="mailto:simon.boardman@gmail.com">simon.boardman@gmail.com</a>

## Currently

I am in my final year of the NHS Scientist Training Programme, specialising in Bioinformatics (Genomics). In my day-to-day role I run and develop diagnostic pipelines for processing patient samples within the Genomic Diagnostics Laboratory. I also work with academic collaborators on bespoke research projects. Typically this involves analysing data from exome sequencing.

In collaboration with other clinical bioinformaticians I create and maintain scientific software for clinical use. The main languages I use are Python and Perl. A key part of my job is communicating results to genetics clinical scientists and working in multi-disciplinary teams to design and implement new tests to improve the services available to patients.

My main project is the design and validation of a new pipeline for copy number variation detection using low level whole genome sequencing. Implementing a novel technique has given me extensive experience evaluating software and developing new workflows which conform to ISO standards.

As part of my training I completed an elective at the Haematology Molecular Diagnostics Service in Leeds Teaching Hospital Trust. I carried out a pilot study investigating the utility of targeted RNA-seq for expression analysis in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients.
