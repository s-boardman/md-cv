## Currently

I am in my final year of the NHS Scientist Training Programme, specialising in Bioinformatics (Genomics). In my day-to-day role I run and develop diagnostic pipelines for processing patient samples within the Genomic Diagnostics Laboratory. I develop in Python and Perl, collaborating with other bioinformaticians and geneticists to continuously improve patient care provided by the department.

My main project is the design and validation of a pipeline for copy number variation detection using low level whole genome sequencing.
