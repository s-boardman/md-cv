## Currently

I am in my final year of the NHS Scientist Training Programme, specialising in Bioinformatics (Genomics). In my day-to-day role I run and develop diagnostic pipelines for processing patient samples within the Genomic Diagnostics Laboratory. I develop in Python and Perl working in collaboration with other clinical bioinformaticians to create and maintain scientific software for clinical use. A key part of my job is communicating results to genetics clinical scientists and working in multi-disciplinary teams to design and implement new tests to improve the services available to patients.

My main project is the design and validation of a pipeline for copy number variation detection using low level whole genome sequencing. 

I also work with academic collaborators on bespoke research projects. This demands a heuristic and well documented approach is required to deliver reliable reproducible results at forefront of translational genomics.
